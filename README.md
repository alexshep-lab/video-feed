# VideoFeed

Self-hosted local video streaming service. FastAPI backend + React frontend,
FFmpeg (with optional NVENC/NVDEC acceleration) for all heavy media work,
SQLite for the index.

## Run

```powershell
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7999` (or whichever port `run.py` exposes).

### Configure library folders

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and point at your content:

```env
VIDEOFEED_LIBRARY_DIRS_RAW=G:\AlexShep_Labs_Projects\video_feed\videos;D:\MyVideoArchive
```

On Windows, separate folders with `;`. You can also add/remove libraries
at runtime from the UI (Library page).

### Optional: encoder mode

`VIDEOFEED_ENCODER_MODE` (`auto` / `cpu` / `nvenc`) picks the video encoder
for compression, HLS transcoding and WMV/AVI conversion:

- `auto` — use NVENC when detected, otherwise `libx264`
- `cpu` — force CPU (`libx264`), also disables NVDEC hardware decode
- `nvenc` — force NVIDIA NVENC unconditionally (errors if unavailable)

NVENC detection is cached — restart the server after installing a new FFmpeg.

### Frontend dev server (optional)

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

For production you build with `npm run build` and copy `frontend/dist/` into
`frontend_static/` — this is what FastAPI serves. `index.html` is sent with
`Cache-Control: no-cache` so fresh builds pick up automatically.

## Features

### Library

- Infinite-scroll grid with adjustable tile size
- Thumbnails, hover preview (8 frames) and duration overlay on each card
- Filters: search, tag, category, library folder, codec, duration, vertical/landscape, favorite
- Sort by newest / oldest / title / duration / size / most viewed / last watched / shuffle
- Multi-folder scanning (`videos/` plus any external paths in `.env`);
  subfolders containing videos are auto-registered and enabled
- Soft delete (hide), Windows Recycle Bin move, or permanent hard delete

### Watch page

- Adaptive player: native MP4/WebM/MKV/MOV stream with HTTP `Range` support,
  or HLS via `hls.js` when a variant ladder exists
- For videos whose source needs conversion (WMV/AVI), the raw endpoint
  automatically serves the browser-friendly MP4 once conversion finishes
- 16-frame contact sheet ("frame palette") below the player
- Hotkey-free: tags editable inline, confirm / favorite / compress / convert
  available from the watch page
- Recommendations based on shared tags + same library + similar duration

### Review mode

Open any video from the Unconfirmed section of the library with review context
encoded in the URL. An amber banner appears at the top of the watch page.
**Confirm** or **Hard Delete** then jumps to the next matching video
automatically — no need to go back to the library between clicks.

A dedicated **Ready to review** checkbox in Unconfirmed mode filters to
videos that are actually playable right now:

- Native container, or conversion already `completed`
- Contact sheet (16-frame palette) already on disk

### Maintenance page

All long-running / batch operations live here. Each section has a status
panel (queue size, worker state, batch progress, per-file progress) and a
**Stop** button that drops the queue and kills the active ffmpeg if one is
running. None of the workers auto-start jobs — everything is user-triggered.

#### Duplicates

Exact duplicates via partial fingerprint (SHA-1 of file size + first 64 KB +
last 64 KB of the file). Fast on slow drives — video container headers fully
fit into that window, so for files of matching size the chance of false
positives is negligible.

Also a perceptual-hash (average-hash of the thumbnail) mode for visually
similar clips.

#### Compression (downscale to FHD)

Videos over a chosen min height get scaled to max 1920×1080, re-encoded to
H.264 + AAC with `+faststart`, and the original is archived to
`L:\Prvt\big\` (configurable). Uses NVENC when available.

- Candidate filter respects file existence (ghost rows are skipped)
- Collision-safe: if the target path already belongs to another DB row
  (e.g. a pre-existing FHD copy next to the 4K source), metadata and tags
  are merged into that row and the source is soft-deleted
- After success, the cached thumbnail / contact sheet for the video are
  invalidated and regenerated so they match the new content

#### Browser conversion (WMV / AVI → MP4)

Non-browser-playable containers are converted to H.264/AAC/MP4.

- **Fast path (remux)** for H.264-in-AVI: video stream is copied, only audio
  re-encoded. Seconds per file instead of minutes.
- **Full re-encode** with NVENC for real WMV3/VC-1/MPEG-4 ASP sources, with
  automatic CPU-decode fallback if NVDEC rejects the codec
- Original WMV/AVI is kept in place — conversion output goes to
  `media/converted/{video_id}.mp4` and `converted_path` is stored on the row
- Scanner auto-queues new WMV/AVI (no auto-queue on startup — jobs picked
  only when the user clicks)
- Candidate list is paginated (20 per page), sortable by H.264-first (remux
  wins surface first), smallest, largest, or name
- Multi-select checkboxes for custom batching ("Convert Selected")
- Hidden under a spoiler so the page stays light for huge libraries

#### Video palettes (contact sheets)

Single-click batch generation of 16-frame contact sheets for videos that
don't yet have one.

- Uses the effective playable source (converted MP4 if available, else
  original) — faster decode and matches what the viewer will actually watch
- NVDEC decode when available, automatic CPU fallback
- Eagerly regenerated from compressor and converter workers after successful
  jobs so the next WatchPage open is instant

#### Encoder info

`GET /api/maintenance/encoder` reports the active video encoder
(`h264_nvenc` vs `libx264`) and whether NVENC is available in the local
FFmpeg build.

### Stats

Overview of total videos, size, duration, favorites, views, watch time,
plus most-viewed / most-watched / recent history / popular tags / favorites /
daily activity charts.

**Collection Pipeline** panel shows progress on preparing the library:
confirmed vs unconfirmed count, ready-to-review count, palette coverage
with a progress bar, and a per-status breakdown of the browser-conversion
queue (pending / processing / completed / failed / skipped / none).
Useful for tracking "how much review work is left" at a glance.

### Cleanup

Two admin endpoints for pruning dead rows without going through the UI:

- `GET /api/maintenance/missing-files` + `POST .../purge` — hard-delete DB
  rows whose source file no longer exists on disk. Derived assets
  (thumbs, palette, converted, preview frames) are cleaned too.
- `GET /api/maintenance/short-videos?max_seconds=420` + `POST .../purge` —
  preview / remove videos shorter than N seconds. Files go to Windows
  Recycle Bin (not `unlink`), rows with `duration IS NULL` are skipped,
  and locked files leave the DB row intact for a later retry.

## Notes

- Scanner walks libraries recursively, reconciles moved files (same name +
  size), and soft-deletes rows whose files disappeared. Files that vanish
  between directory listing and stat (network-share races, concurrent
  moves) are skipped silently — next scan picks them up.
- Palette generation has a single-frame fallback when multi-seek xstack
  fails on corrupted H.264 NAL streams, so one broken video doesn't block
  the batch.
- Server uses `timeout_graceful_shutdown=3` so Ctrl+C doesn't hang waiting
  for open Range streams from the browser.
- WatchPage keyboard shortcuts are bound globally (capture phase on
  `window`), not on the video element — they work regardless of which UI
  element has focus: `F` fullscreen, `Space` play/pause, `←/→` seek ±5 s,
  `↑/↓` volume ±10 %.
- If `ffprobe` is not installed, videos still get indexed but duration /
  resolution / codec stay empty.
- If file-based SQLite isn't writable, the backend falls back to an
  in-memory database so the app still starts (library state is lost on
  restart in that case).
- If `ffmpeg` is unavailable, thumbnails and palettes fall back to a generated
  SVG placeholder.
- On RTX 2080 (Turing) NVDEC doesn't support MPEG-4 ASP (Xvid/DivX), MJPEG
  or some old WMV variants — these automatically fall back to CPU decode.
  NVENC encode still applies even when decode is on CPU.
